# Dense-Net
This is a [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org) implementation of a DenseNet. 

## Datasets 
To get the datasets the DenseNet model is being trained on, you must first run the following repo: https://github.com/yoonkim97/ChestXRay-ImageFiltering

Please check  ``` main.py ``` to ensure that the datasets used to train the model matches the datasets that were filtered in the ChestXRay-ImageFiltering repo. 

## Running the code 

### Dependencies
* CUDA 10.1
* PyTorch
* At least **one** GPU

### Running

```
cd code
python main.py
```
## Branches
There are multiple branches on this repository which refers to different densenet models.
